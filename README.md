# Text Toxicity

## Motivation
This repository contains the code for our Machine Learning final (ECE492 @ North Carolina State University).  The code is a modified version of the tutorial online found on this [Real Python Article](https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/).

## Abstract
Natural language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence and machine learning that consist of how a computer can process or interact with human (natural) languages. We are applying deep neural networks to blocks of text that will be able to read the mood from the text in order to categorize it in a very simple way. We will use one of two categories, positive or negative, to tell whether an online comment is conveying a positive or negative tone. To achieve this, we first started with a baseline model to later compare with our deep neural network model.  While our model is still simple in nature, the deep neural network structure can allow for further hidden layers that will add to the accuracy of our categorizations.
